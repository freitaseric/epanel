## About The Project

EPanel is a comprehensive solution for developers and hobbyists who want to manage
their Docker-based applications and servers through an intuitive web interface.
Built with a modern, secure, and high-performance tech stack, our primary goal is
to provide a top-tier self-hosting experience that is both powerful and easy to maintain.

This project was born out of a desire for a control panel that is transparent,
community-driven, and built on robust, modern technologies like Kotlin and Rust.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Intuitive Web Interface:** A clean and responsive UI built with React to
manage your services effortlessly.
* **Robust & Scalable API:** A powerful backend powered by Ktor and Kotlin,
designed for performance and reliability.
* **Secure & High-Performance Daemon:** A lightweight system daemon written in
Rust for secure, low-level interaction with the Docker API.
* **Docker-Native Integration:** Full control over containers, volumes, and networks.
* **Real-time Logs & Stats:** Monitor your applications' health and output directly
from the panel.
* **Designed for Self-Hosting:** Full ownership of your data and infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

EPanel is built as a monorepo with three core components:

* **Frontend (Panel):** `React` | `Vite` | `TanStack Router`
* **Backend (API):** `Kotlin` | `Ktor` | `PostgreSQL` | `Redis`
* **System Service (Daemon):** `Rust` | `Docker API (bollard)`

## 📁 Project Structure

This project is a monorepo containing all three services:

```three

## 🚀 Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up EPanel for local development.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or newer)
* [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
(or newer)
* [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
* [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/)

### Installation Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-github-username/epanel.git](https://github.com/your-github-username/epanel.git)
    cd epanel
    ```

2. **Configuration**
    This project uses environment files for configuration. You'll need to set up
    the config for the API.

    ```sh
    # In the /api directory
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Now, edit the newly created `.env` file to match your local database, Redis,
    and other settings.

3. **Run the Backend (API)**
    The API requires the PostgreSQL and Redis instances to be running.

    ```sh
    cd api
    ./gradlew run
    ```

    The API should now be running, typically on port `8080`.

4. **Run the System Daemon**
    The Daemon requires Docker and Redis to be running.

    ```sh
    cd daemon
    cargo run --release
    ```

    The Daemon will connect to Redis and wait for commands from the API.

5. **Run the Frontend (Panel)**
    Navigate back to the project root to run the web interface.

    ```sh
    # From the root directory
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    The EPanel should now be accessible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
    (or the port specified by Vite).
